This is a small project recreating the stable diffusion architecture, it contains diffusion, attention, VAE, and a pipleline to put it all together, we use pretrained weights for inference however due to limited gpu, we reduce the model weights to just contain the weights, we throw out everything else (optimizer, schedulers, metadata, callbacks, duplicate EMA). and achieve an output to demonstrate a PoC.
